## 📡 **Customer Churn Prediction - SaiKet Systems Internship**  

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes **customer churn** in a telecommunications company and develops **predictive models** to identify at-risk customers. The goal is to provide **actionable insights** and improve **customer retention**.  

### 🔍 **Tasks Completed**  
✅ **Data Preparation**  
- Handled missing values  
- Encoded categorical variables  

✅ **Data Splitting**  
- Split data into **80% training** and **20% testing**  

✅ **Feature Selection**  
- Identified key features affecting churn (e.g., contract type, monthly charges, tenure)  

✅ **Model Selection & Training**  
- Experimented with **Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting**  

✅ **Model Evaluation**  
- Assessed performance using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**
